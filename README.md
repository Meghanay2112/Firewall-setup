# Task 4 – Setup and Use a Firewall

## Objective
To configure and test basic firewall rules to block network traffic.

## Tool Used
Windows Defender Firewall

## Steps Performed
1. Opened firewall using wf.msc
2. Viewed existing inbound rules
3. Created new inbound rule to block TCP port 23 (Telnet)
4. Verified rule creation
5. Deleted rule to restore system

## Why Block Port 23?
Port 23 is used by Telnet which is insecure because it sends data in plain text.

## Outcome
